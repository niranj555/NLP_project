Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by the spore forming bacterium Bacillus Anthracis. It occurs most 
commonly in mammals, including sheep, goats,camels, and antelope, but can also occur in humans. Humans infected 
with anthrax normally have been exposed to infected animals, tissue from infected animals, or infected animals 
products through their occupations (in agriculture or animal husbandry). Anthrax, however, has been used throughout 
history as a biological weapon. Anthrax is linked to several devastating plagues that killed both humans and 
livestock. In 1500 B . C ., the fifth Egyptian plague, which affected livestock, and the sixth, known as the 
plague of boils, were linked to anthrax; the Black Bane of the 1600s is also thought to have been anthrax and 
killed 60,000 cattle in Europe. Robert Koch confirmed the bacterial origin of anthrax in 1876. Not long after
this discovery, anthrax began to emerge as a biological weapon. German agents in the United States are believed 
to have injected horses, mules, and cattle with anthrax on their way to Europe during World War I. In 1937, Japan 
began a biological warfare program in Manchuria that included tests of anthrax. The United Kingdom experimented with 
anthrax at Guinard Island off the east coast of Scotland in 1942, an area that was only decontaminated more than 50 years 
later. During the years of World War II, several other countries, including the United States, began to develop anthrax 
as a weapon.
